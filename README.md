# render-python

This is a python API setup to interact via python with render databases and facilitate python scripting of tilespec creation
see
https://github.com/saalfeldlab/render
it presently interacts with render via a web-api, though a couple functions are presently implemented with the java client scripts that are part of render, ideally those would be cutout.

tilespec.py is a set of python objects that facilitate serializing and deserializing objects to/from json.
